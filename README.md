Super Galactic Age Calculator.

Week 5 project for Epicodus utilizing webpacks and testing with jest. 11.15.2019
By Colman Currie

Fifth independent project I completed for Epicodus. This project is focused on building out separate .js forms, using webpacks to bundle and testing with jest.

Setup/Installation Requirements
Using your terminal you can git clone this project to your desktop.

Then you will call the directory using your terminal, make sure you're in the desktop and cd "project name here"

If you don't wish to make any changes you can simply double click the index.html inside that cloned directory and it will open an html page in your internet browser.

Or visit the page here:

Specs
1. Allow users to enter their age.
2. Return their age in Mercury years || expected outcome: their age*0.24
3. Return their age in Venus years || expected outcome: their age*0.62
4. Returns their age in Mars years || expected outcome: their age*1.88
5. Returns their age in Jupiter years || expected outcome: their age*11.86
6. Allow user to enter if they are Male or Female, then let them know the average life expectancy on each planet and how much longer they have on their planet.... || expected output: Men have an average life expectancy of 77 while women are 78(in the US~2017). Return life expectancy minus their current galactic age.
