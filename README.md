Week 5 project for Epicodus utilizing webpacks and testing with jest. 11.15.2019
By Colman Currie

Fifth independent project I completed for Epicodus. This project is focused on building out separate .js forms, using webpacks to bundle and testing with jest.

Setup/Installation Requirements
Using your terminal you can git clone this project to your desktop. run "npm run build" in your terminal after opening the project. This will install webpacks. 

Then you will call the directory using your terminal, make sure you're in the desktop and cd "project name here"

If you don't wish to make any changes you can simply double click the index.html inside that cloned directory and it will open an html page in your internet browser.
